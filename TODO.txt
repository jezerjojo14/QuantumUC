Look at Afrah's python notebook
	-- Done. HHL seems fine.

Run simple circuit to confirm bitstring ordering
	-- Done. More significant registers on the
	   left as expected

Calculate cost hamiltonian manually and compare to
classically computed one
	-- Not necessary. Classical QAOA test working.

Function to view statevector as its own module
	-- Done.

Create quantum circuit for cost Hamiltonian separately
and view matrix and compare
